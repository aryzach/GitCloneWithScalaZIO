use the zio-nio clientM to write to and read from git server to get refDiscovery working
	- create a ByteBuffer and try to write to the connection. Can I see this on the git server echo? Can I turn the packet line formated string into a ByteBuffer and write it to the socket? If so, then can I read the response?
